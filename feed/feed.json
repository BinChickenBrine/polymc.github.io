If you haven't, please <a href=\"https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/java-edition-moving-house\">read their announcement here</a>, and then come back to read this article.</p>\n<p>With this new change, the game's login system will change significantly, and a lot of people are understandably concerned about what this means for the future of MultiMC, so we are making this post to hopefully put your minds at ease.</p>\n<p>In the coming months, MultiMC will be updated to support the new login system. <strong>As of now, Mojang has not started the migration process</strong>, so we are hoping to support the new system before they begin migrating accounts, but we can't guarantee that will happen.</p>\n<p>If Mojang begins migrating accounts before MultiMC has been updated to support the new system, we advise that you wait until MultiMC is updated before migrating your account. <strong>If you migrate your account before MultiMC supports the new login system, you will not be able to use MultiMC until the new system is implemented.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Also, please do not fall prey to random internet strangers telling you to migrate your Mojang account before Mojang tells you it's time to do so.</strong> You will be notified either in the vanilla launcher, or the <a href=\"https://minecraft.net/\">Minecraft.net</a> website when logged in. Not a random internet page with a login form. We may also have something that notifies you in MultiMC in an upcoming update, but please verify that it is an official, unmodified build from <a href=\"https://multimc.org/\">multimc.org</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>The migration should happen only through <a href=\"https://minecraft.net/\">Minecraft.net</a>.</strong></p>\n<p>Once MultiMC has implemented the new login system, we will post another article on here, and you will then be able to safely migrate your account and continue using MultiMC as before.</p>\n",

In general, it should be easier to find the right settings menu without getting things completely wrong on the first try.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/MultiMC/MultiMC5/issues/1997\">GH-1997</a>: MultiMC now supports Java 9.</p>\n<p>This does not mean that the current mod loaders and mods do, but you can run Vanilla Minecraft with Java 9 now.</p>\n<p>However, Java 9 will come up last in the lists when multiple versions are installed and its use is strongly discouraged.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/MultiMC/MultiMC5/issues/2026\">GH-2026</a>: You can launch Minecraft 1.13 snapshots - and hopefully also 1.13 once it is released.</p>\n<p>The bare minimum of changes needed for 1.13 to launch has been done.</p>\n<p>This does not mean support for modded 1.13!</p>\n<p>It is not yet clear what it will even look like and what exactly will be needed for Forge to be able to install properly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bundled Qt libraries have been updated to version 5.6.3 on macOS and Windows</p>\n<p>This means less issues with SSL encryption on macOS and better support for HiDPI/retina displays, along with many bug fixes.<br />\nThe workarounds for SSL problems on macOS have been removed thanks to this.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Linux builds were moved to a newer version of Ubuntu (14.04)</p>\n<p>This means better support on newer distribution releases, and dropping support for older distributions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bundled OpenSSL library on Windows no longer requires Visual Studio runtime libraries.</p>\n<p>This should avoid issues with missing runtime libraries.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/MultiMC/MultiMC5/issues/1855\">GH-1855</a>: The instance window now has an offline launch button.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/MultiMC/MultiMC5/issues/1886\">GH-1886</a>: UI now clarifies that MultiMC proxy settings do not apply to the game.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It is now possible to package MultiMC on linux without hacks.</p>\n<p>The build system has a concept of 'install layouts'. Example Arch linux package that uses this (multimc-git) is <a href=\"https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/multimc-git\">available in the AUR</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Wrapper commands now support arguments.</p>\n<p>Previously, they would be treated as a single command -- spaces and all.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>UI elements that set maximum JVM memory are now limited to the amount of system memory present.</p>\n<p>Before, they were hardcoded.</p>\n<p>This is to accommodate the needs of some new mods for ancient Minecraft versions that do not work well with the applet wrapper.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>On instance launch, the used GPU and graphics driver are reported - but only on linux.</p>\n<p>Other platforms will hopefully get this in the future.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There are some under the hood improvements for ancient Minecraft versions and versions not provided by Mojang.</p>\n<pre><code>- The `haspaid` parameter is set for the applet wrapper.\n- MultiMC will prefer to use `.minecraft` instead of `minecraft` folder inside the instances now.\n- There is some preliminary support for classic multiplayer - see [this workflowy list](https://workflowy.com/s/2EyDMcp7CU#/1cbfc198cf28) for details.\n- A new `noapplet` trait has been added to allow running legacy Minecraft versions without the applet wrapper.\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Mods without changed metadata (Example Mod) are now listed under their filename instead.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tweaker list in metadata now overrides the order of already present tweakers.</p>\n<p>This allows running <a href=\"http://www.vivecraft.org/\">Vivecraft</a>. Official support will hopefully follow.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Instance icons can now be in the SVG format. Also, aspect ratio of SVG icons is now preserved in the instance toolbar.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/MultiMC/MultiMC5/issues/1082\">GH-1082</a>: It is now possible to disable and enable version components (packages) similarly to mods.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A new material design / flat icon theme has been added.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When changing instance component versions, the present version is selected first.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"bugfixes\" tabindex=\"-1\">Bugfixes <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://polymc.org/polymc.org/news/0-6-update/#bugfixes\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://paste.ee/\">paste.ee</a> upload now works again.</p>\n<p>MultiMC now uses its new API.

The list of available pages in the instance window changes with instance state.</p>\n<p>Multiple instances can now run from the same MultiMC - It's even more <strong>multi</strong> now.</p>\n<p>On launch, the main window is kept open and running instances are marked with a badge. Opening the instance window is no longer the default action. Second activation of a running instance opens the instance window.</p>\n<p>MultiMC can be entirely closed, keeping Minecraft instances running. However, if you close MultiMC, play time tracking, logging and crash reporting will not work.</p>\n<p>Accounts which are in use are marked as such. If you plan to run multiple instances with multiple accounts, it is advisable to not set a default account to make it ask which one to use on launch.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It is no longer possible to run multiple copies of MultiMC from a single folder</p>\n<p>This generally caused strange configuration and Mojang login issues because the running MultiMC copies did not know about each other.</p>\n<p>With the ability to launch multiple instances with different accounts, it is no longer needed.</p>\n<p>Trying to run a second copy will focus the existing window. If MultiMC was started without a main window, a new main window will be opened. If the second copy is launching an instance from the command line, it will launch in the first copy instead.</p>\n<p>This feature is also used for better checking of correct update completion (<a href=\"https://github.com/MultiMC/MultiMC5/issues/1726\">GH-1726</a>). It should no longer be possible for MultiMC to end up in a state when it is unable to start - the old version checks that the new one can start and respond to liveness checks by writing a file.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/MultiMC/MultiMC5/issues/903\">GH-903</a>: MultiMC now supports theming</p>\n<p>By default, it comes with a Dark, Bright, System (the old default) and Custom theme.</p>\n<p>The Custom theme can change all of the colors, change the Qt widget theme and style the whole UI with CSS rules.<br />\nFiles you can customize are created in <code>themes/custom/</code>. The CSS theming is similar to what TeamSpeak uses.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, this is a start, not a final solution. If you are interested in making custom themes and would like to shape the direction this takes in the future, ask on Discord. :)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Translations have been overhauled</p>\n<p>You no longer need to restart MultiMC to change its active translation. MultiMC also asks which translation to use on the first start.</p>\n<p>There is a lot that has to be done with translations, but at least now it should be easier to work with them and use them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>MultiMC now includes Google Analytics</p>\n<p>The purpose of this is to determine where to focus future effort.

      "content_html": "<p>Hello from the MultiMC development team! We have an exciting announcement today. For a while, one of our developers, Jan (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/02JanDal\">@02JanDal</a>), has been working on a system for easily downloading and installing mods. The system is called QuickMod, and today we're excited to finally be able to show off an early proof of concept.</p>\n<p>Before you read further, please keep in mind that this is still in early development. It is quite buggy, but we're working on smoothing it out. Everything here is subject to change and we <strong>do not have an ETA</strong> for how long it will take to finish. It's done when it's done.</p>\n<h2 id=\"demo-video\" tabindex=\"-1\">Demo Video <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://polymc.org/polymc.org/news/introducing-quickmods/#demo-video\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>If you're too lazy to read, here is a video of Forkk demonstrating the installation of a bunch of mods using the QuickMod system:</p>\n<iframe width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5OBKT7w6p6w?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n<h2 id=\"quickmods\" tabindex=\"-1\">QuickMods <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://polymc.org/polymc.org/news/introducing-quickmods/#quickmods\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Once upon a time, when installing mods, you had to mess with the Minecraft jar file. Then came Forge and other great stuff to ease the installation, as well as MultiCraft (the predecessor of MultiMC), making installation of mods even easier. But it doesn't stop there, sometime in December last year I started working on a feature I call QuickMods. There are two parts to them, the JSON specification (available <a href=\"http://02jandal.github.io/QuickModDoc/\">here</a>) and the implementation in MultiMC 5.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-quickmod-file-format\" tabindex=\"-1\">The QuickMod file format <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://polymc.org/polymc.org/news/introducing-quickmods/#the-quickmod-file-format\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>QuickMods are small text files which contain information about a mod such as its name, description, and where to download it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-do-they-work\" tabindex=\"-1\">How do they work? <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://polymc.org/polymc.org/news/introducing-quickmods/#how-do-they-work\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>To install a QuickMod, you simply add it into MultiMC via its URL, or a file. Once the QuickMod is added to MultiMC, it can be installed into any instance via the &quot;Install&quot; button in the mod edit dialog.</p>\n<p>When a QuickMod is installed into an instance, MultiMC will get the mod's download link, determine what other mods that mod requires, and then go through a download process for everything it needs to downloaded. Mods with direct download links are downloaded directly, while, for mods which must go through <a href=\"http://adf.ly/\">adf.ly</a> or some other website, MultiMC will open a small web browser window with whatever page the mod should be downloaded from. Mod developers still get their ad revenue, and users get a really easy way to download mods. Everybody wins.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-are-they-made\" tabindex=\"-1\">How are they made? <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://polymc.org/polymc.org/news/introducing-quickmods/#how-are-they-made\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>QuickMods are simple JSON files which contain information about mods. Jan has written a <a href=\"https://github.com/02JanDal/QuickModGenerator\">command line tool</a> and a <a href=\"https://github.com/robotbrain/quickmod-gradle\">gradle plugin</a> to simplify the process of creating QuickMod files.</p>\n<p>Anyone can create one, too, not just the mod developer. QuickMods don't distribute the mod files themselves, either; they download mods from the original download location, so you won't need to have permission from the mod developer to use them for your mod packs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"some-more-information\" tabindex=\"-1\">Some more information <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://polymc.org/polymc.org/news/introducing-quickmods/#some-more-information\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>How does this relate to the Curse client?\n<ul>\n<li>Development of QuickMods started some time before the Curse/FTB deal, and it will continue even after the release of the Curse client. This either means that they will be competing systems (though we plan to try have some sort of bridge), or (hopefully, but, unlikely) that Curse will support QuickMods and supply QuickMod files.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Which versions of Minecraft does this work for?\n<ul>\n<li>Currently only 1.6 and up, though this is only a limit in the implementation, the QuickMod files aren't limited.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It'll still be some time until this is ready for release, in the mean time we'd love to hear any thoughts or ideas, the best way to reach us is via IRC (#MultiMC on <a href=\"http://irc.esper.net/\">irc.esper.net</a>).</p>\n<h3 id=\"important-notice\" tabindex=\"-1\">Important notice <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://polymc.org/polymc.org/news/introducing-quickmods/#important-notice\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Both the QuickMod specification and the implementation in MultiMC are still under heavy development, and likely to change. Be ready for incompatibilities until we have a stable release out.</p>\n<p>~ Jan and Forkk</p>\n",

We're going to update A.S.A.P. and hope to get a build out with it tonight (US time).</p>\n<p>If you don't want to wait for the update tonight, you can replace three files in your MultiMC folder with newer versions. Specifically, &quot;libeay32.dll&quot;, &quot;libssl32.dll&quot; and &quot;ssleay32.dll&quot;. We use the OpenSSL distribution from <a href=\"http://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html\">Shining Light Productions</a> - download their &quot;Win32 OpenSSL v1.0.1g Light&quot; installer, run it, grab those files from the installation directory (&quot;C:/OpenSSL-Win32/&quot; by default), and copy them in to your MultiMC folder.</p>\n<p>I'll also update the title of this blog post when we've pushed an updated version out.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/drayshak\">@Drayshak</a></p>\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> We've pushed new stable, release candidate and development versions out with the fix. Update as soon as you can to get it!</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>Today, I am happy to announce MultiMC 6, a new, reimagined version of MultiMC written in the <strong>best language ever</strong>, Haskell. MultiMC 6 will be far more stable and faster than MultiMC 5, and will make your Minecraft launching experience much more enjoyable. Furthermore, we've decided that MultiMC's scope shouldn't be limited to simply launching Minecraft. That's why we'll be adding support for several more games to MultiMC, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Factorio</li>\n<li>Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas</li>\n<li>Skyrim</li>\n<li>Kerbal Space Program</li>\n<li>And much more!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, we will be providing a plugin interface which will allow third party developers to write plugins for launching other games as well. We'll be sure to make the plugin API full of crazy monads and cryptic functions that don't quite make sense. We know that's what Haskell developers truly enjoy.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, we'll have to make some changes as well. Due to the lack of Windows users, we'll be dropping support for Windows in MultiMC 6 and focusing on Linux, OS X, and <a href=\"https://www.haiku-os.org/\">Haiku OS</a> for further developments. Honestly, it doesn't really matter too much, since nobody really uses Windows.</p>\n<p>That's all there is to say for now. Work on MultiMC 5 will be dropped tomorrow, and we'll begin development on MultiMC 6 immediately. Expect an early alpha build that doesn't quite work some time in late 2016.</p>\n<p>Thanks for using MultiMC. If you have any questions, you may <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Forkk13\">contact me on Twitter</a>.</p>\n<p>P.S. - Happy April Fools' Day!</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>I thought I'd write a blog post discussing the current state of MultiMC, MultiMC 5 development progress, and the future.</p>\n<p>First, we have a new, dedicated website, and you're looking at it! The idea was to keep it clean, simple and functional, and I think we've achieved that. Things might still change a bit but the framework is there for us to use.</p>\n<p>So who is &quot;us&quot;? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/peterixxx\">peterix</a> and myself (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/drayshak\">@Drayshak</a>) are pushing development of MultiMC 5 forward, I've been working on the website, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/forkk13\">Forkk</a> is helping with infrastructure, and there have been notable contributions to the project from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TakSuyu\">@TakSuyu</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Stiepen22\">Kilobyte</a> and Orochimarufan. (If you think you've made a contribution that I've left out, tell me!).</p>\n<p>Development of MultiMC 5 is going well, and we publish &quot;test builds&quot; regularly. We're changing our build system so for now you can find them on our IRC channel (<a href=\"http://webchat.esper.net/?nick=&amp;channels=MultiMC\">Esper/#MultiMC</a>), but eventually they'll be published on this website.</p>\n<p>The test builds have most of the core functionality implemented and should be fine for general use, but keep in mind that it might have some rough edges. Keep a copy of builds that work for you and report bugs (on IRC or using the <a href=\"http://multimc.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/issues\">Issue Tracker</a>). You can follow most of our progress on IRC or by using the <a href=\"https://www.pivotaltracker.com/s/projects/869353\">Dev Tracker</a>.</p>\n<p>If you find something broken (or missing) in MultiMC 5, chances are that we're working on it. The biggest omission right now is the lack of an updater, so be sure to check the download links for updated builds. We're working with Forkk to get a good build system going, the single links are just there so people can get access to builds as we make them. As of right now there are no OS X test builds because getting the build system set up for that is considerably more difficult than getting Windows and Linux working.</p>\n<p>Forkk's posted before on his blog about the reasons for the lengthy delay in getting MultiMC 5 out, the main one being that Mojang fundamentally changed the way that Minecraft is launched (for the better). We were becoming increasingly unhappy with wxWidgets so the big change made it a good time for a rewrite in Qt, and we're having much more success with it.</p>\n<p>That's everything I can think to talk about right now! If you like what we're doing throw us some love on Twitter, we've been working hard on moving towards stable builds and a little love is always appreciated.</p>\n<p>Drayshak</p>\n",
